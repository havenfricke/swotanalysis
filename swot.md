SWOT ANALYSIS
_______________________________________________

STRENGTHS

- Advantages that I may have that others don't have is my sheer tenacity and my ability to understand systems. Persistence is sought after in my waking life partially due to my upbringing circumstance which were fairly unfavorable. Since a young age I have had a drive to look behind the curtain of happenings and seek out intuitively what systems are at play. I also am genuinely curious about the anomolies that arise in life.

- Something I do better than anyone else is nothing. Humility concerns ability far greater than that which I compare myself to.

- Others have said my strengths are my:

    - Tenacity/Intensity
    - Patience
    - Perception

OPPORTUNITIES

- My specialty I feel is becoming visual/information design in front end software development. I've done my fair share of visiting websites for music festivals, artists, musicians, and promoters since I worked in the music industry. I love the design aspect of websites and the flow information to be seemless. I have always favored a website with good UI and so far have loved putting this into practice during this course on t he front-end side of development.

- I do have ideas on how to improve businessness but have never really had the chance to express them. Like mentioned previously, I have a gift in understanding systems. Not just computer systems but habitual human systems. I think its fun to step outside of the box of habit and see a better/more efficient way of doing something. I like feng shui in the workplace and in the home alike.

- The way you take advantage of a growing market is to find important niches whithin industries lacking rich and efficient methods and to implement one. With philanthropy and evoloution in mind - by niche in the market I do not mean Bezos level profit-driving. Instead, something that seems a necessity yet nobody knew about until it showed up. Not for profit, but for people.

WEAKNESSES

- People around me may see my weakness as restlessness. I am usually always doing something. Upon exiting the military, I took up consistent meditation. I have not been entirely adherant with it but but, for the most part of kept moditating to aid in the busy mind. It helps but I still bounce off the walls with things I'm doing. Antoher weakness others may see is my constantly-changing interest. Curiosity killed the cat type situation, but I can't help myself. So much to see in life and so little time.

- My negative work habits are not spending enough time with others as peers. I interact and I socialize but really getting to know people has been a struggle for some reason. I think I have some trust issues between my upbringing and being in the military amidst other savages. I like my emotions guarded until I know someone.

- A personality trait that might hold me back in my career is my everchanging interests. I feel myself as I get older my sparatic interest calming, but it's definitely still there. I'm trying to channel it into artistic ability as I get older as well but sometimes it still spills over into larger interests I'm currently invested in.

THREATS

- Obstacles I currently face are financial familial, organizational, and spiritual. Resting my mind and identifying thoughts as clouds has been a good tool. I definitely could be more organized but do try my best. Decluttering my inner and outer worlds is a constant battle.

- My weaknessness could definitely become threats but I don't think I am currently in a position where this is pressing. I've done a lot of work put myself together.
